# Calculate fees when sending money through Paypal.

# When sending money through PayPal, the amount sent get deducted a commission:
# a percentage of the amount you're sending plus a flat fee.
#
# If you send $100, and the fee rate is 2.9%, the person you're sending the
# money to, receives $96.80.
#
# It works through the following function:
#
# f(x, y) = x - x*y/100 - $0.3
#
# Where:
# _x_ is the money you're sending.
# _y_ is the fee rate.
# $0.3 the flat fee.
#
# This makes it somewhat bothersome to calculate how much money I have to send
# when I want to make a payment of $100. With a little algebraic manipulation,
# we get the reverse function, which tells us how much money we have to send,
# so the person receives the amount we want:
#
# g(x,y) = (x + $0.3)*100/(100 - y)
#
# So, to receive $100, the other person must send $103.30.
